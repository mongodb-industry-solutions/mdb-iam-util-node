### Flexible Authentication with `MongoRoleManager`

---

The `MongoRoleManager` class is designed for flexible role and permission management within a MongoDB environment. While the core methods for managing roles and permissions remain consistent, the underlying **configuration will change based on the chosen authentication method**. This is because each authentication type has unique requirements for establishing a secure connection to MongoDB.

The `MongoRoleManager` implements the `IRoleManager` interface, which defines a standard set of methods for managing roles and permissions:

```typescript
/**
 * Interface for authentication strategies.
 * Defines methods for managing roles and permissions in MongoDB.
 */
export interface IRoleManager {
  /**
   * Retrieves the username.
   * @param {string} [username] Optional username for role fetching; may be derived dynamically.
   * @returns username for role fetching based on the authentication method.
   */
  getUsername(username?: string): Promise<string>;

  /**
   * Retrieves the roles assigned to a user.
   * @param {string} username Optional username for role fetching; may be derived dynamically.
   * @returns A promise resolving to a list of roles.
   */
  getUserRoles(username?: string): Promise<string[]>;

  /**
   * Retrieves the privileges associated with a specific role.
   * @param {string} roleName The name of the role.
   * @returns A promise resolving to a list of privileges.
   */
  getPrivilegesOfRole(roleName: string): Promise<string[]>;

  /**
   * Verifies permissions against required permissions.
   * @param {Array<string>} requiredPermissions List of permissions to check against.
   * @param {Array<string>} roleNames Optional list of role names to limit verification scope.
   * @returns A promise resolving to an object containing extra, missing, and present permissions.
   */
  verifyPermissions(
    requiredPermissions: string[],
    roleNames?: string[],
  ): Promise<{ extra: string[]; missing: string[]; present: string[] }>;
}
```

### MongoDB Authentication Configuration Explained

---

The structure of MongoDB connection logic using `MongoClient` remains consistent across authentication mechanisms. You'll generally specify basic options such as `uri`, `tls`, or `authMechanism`, define files or credentials used for authentication, and then call the `connect()` method. However, **only the configuration options differ**, depending on which authentication method is being applied (e.g., SCRAM, AWS IAM, X.509).

Here's a comparison of common authentication methods:

1.  **SCRAM Authentication (`MONGODB-SCRAM-SHA-256` or `MONGODB-SCRAM-SHA-1`)**
    * **Configuration Example**:

        ```javascript
        const options = {
          authMechanism: "SCRAM-SHA-256",
          username: "dbUser",
          password: "securePassword",
          authSource: "admin",
        };
        ```
    * **Purpose**: Uses username-password authentication where credentials are hashed and salted for enhanced security. Recommended for development but less secure for production.

2.  **X.509 Authentication (`MONGODB-X509`)**
    * **Configuration Example**:

        ```javascript
        const options = {
          authMechanism: "MONGODB-X509",
          tls: true,
          tlsCertificateKeyFile: "cert/client.pem",
          tlsCAFile: "cert/ca.pem",
          authSource: "$external",
        };
        ```
    * **Purpose**: Provides passwordless cryptographic authentication using certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Ideal for production environments and compliance needs.

3.  **AWS IAM Authentication (`MONGODB-AWS`)**
    * **Configuration Example**:

        ```javascript
        const options = {
          authMechanism: "MONGODB-AWS",
          awsAccessKeyId: "ACCESS_KEY_ID",
          awsSecretAccessKey: "SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
          awsSessionToken: "SESSION_TOKEN", // Optional for temporary credentials
        };
        ```
    * **Purpose**: Leverages AWS IAM credentials for authentication, simplifying security for cloud-native environments like EC2, Lambda, or containers.

4.  **Kerberos Authentication (`MONGODB-GSSAPI`)**
    * **Configuration Example**:

        ```javascript
        const options = {
          authMechanism: "GSSAPI",
          gssapiServiceName: "mongodb",
          username: "kerberosUsername",
        };
        ```
    * **Purpose**: Integrates with Kerberos for centralized authentication in enterprise environments. Useful for single sign-on (SSO) workflows and LDAP-based directory services.

5.  **LDAP Authentication (`MONGODB-PLAIN`)**
    * **Configuration Example**:

        ```javascript
        const options = {
          authMechanism: "PLAIN",
          ldapAuthentication: true,
          username: "ldapUser",
          password: "securePassword",
        };
        ```
    * **Purpose**: External authentication via LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol). Note that depreciation is planned in MongoDB 8.x.

### Key Takeaway

While the core methods for managing roles and permissions through the `IRoleManager` interface remain consistent, the **authentication-specific options (e.g., certificates for X.509 or passwords for SCRAM)** will vary depending on the chosen authentication method. This flexibility allows organizations to implement security measures aligned with their infrastructure requirements and regulatory standards like SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA.
